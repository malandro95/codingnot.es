abstract: James Socol, the Community Platforms Manager at Mozilla, is writing a great summary about best security pratices web developers must be aware of. Even if mainly focused on Django ironing, it's a must read for every web developer.

Point your browser on [James Socol's website, Cofffe on the keyboard](http://coffeeonthekeyboard.com) and bookmark it. James - the Community Platforms Manager at Mozilla - is writing a great summary about web security focused on Django applications, but valid nonetheless for every framework.

These are the arguments he's covering:

* Basics: locking your car doors.
    * Password Storage
    * XSS: Cross-Site Scripting
    * CSRF: Cross-Site Request Forgeries
    * Injections, SQL and Otherwise
    * Access Control
    * Session Fixation and Hijacking
    * Server Configuration
    * Click-jacking and a little Phishing
    * Stay Up to Date
* Advanced: Some gotchas from my experience and some things you may well see.
    * Mass Assignment
    * Cache Poisoning
    * Bots: Spam, Brute-force, and User Experience
    * PCI-DSS
    * CEF Logging
* What browsers are doing to help.
    * Content Security Policy
    * X-Frame-Options
    * Do Not Track
** Sandboxing

## Mozilla and Django

Maybe you don't know it, but Mozilla uses Django for a lot of things. For example, addons.mozilla.org is based on Django and the [sources are available on GitHub](https://github.com/mozilla/zamboni).

If you're interested about Django and Mozilla, you should check [Mozilla Webdev blog](http://blog.mozilla.org/webdev/tag/django/).

## Read it!

I can't stress it enough: it's a must read for every web developer.
